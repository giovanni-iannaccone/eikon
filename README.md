# 🖼️ eikon - Image Processing Library

eikon is a lightweight and efficient C++ library designed for those who want to handle JPEG, PNG, and PPM files without wading through a swamp of convoluted frameworks. It lets you load, tweak, and create images effortlessly, with built-in tools for adding geometric shapes. And for command-line lovers, there's a nifty utility that makes image manipulation refreshingly straightforward.

"Make art with code, eikon takes care of the boring stuff"
</h3>

## ✨ Features
- **Read images**: Load image files effortlessly into your application
- **Supported formats**: JPEG PPM PNG 
- **Modify Images**: Perform image editing operations with ease
- **Insert Geometric Shapes**: Add lines, rectangles, circles, and more directly into your images
- **Command-Line Utility**: Use the library directly from the command line for quick tasks
- **Dependency-light**: Everything is implemented from scratch or is from the standard library

## 👨‍💻 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/giovanni-iannaccone/eikon
cd eikon
```

2. Install the library on your system:
```bash
sudo make install
```
Follow the <a href="/docs/installation.md">installation guide</a> for detailed instructions on how to install a custom library on your linux system.<br/>

>[!TIP]
>Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/giovanni-iannaccone/eikon/releases/latest">latest release</a> to have a stable and fully-working version of eikon

## 🎨 Usage 
- Library Integration <br/>
Include the library in your C++ project:
```c++
#include <eikon/eikon.hpp>
```

- Use predefined shapes <br/>
The library provides a collection of predefined shapes for use in your project:
```c++
EikonCanvas* canvas = new EikonCanvas(pixels, HEIGHT, WIDTH);

Rectangle rec {150, 200, 100, 200, 0xFFA1FF15};
canvas->draw(rec);
```

- Define your own shapes: <br/>
By using the dependency injection pattern, you can define custom shapes:
```c++

class MyShape: public Drawable {

public:
  void draw(uint32_t **pixels, size_t height, size_t width) override {
    // code
  }
}

MyShape myshape = MyShape();
canvas->draw(myshape);
```

Refer to `./src/shapes.cpp` for the implementation details of the default shapes.

- Linking process: <br/>
If you use eikon in your project, remember to add `-leikon` to g++'s flags.

## 🧃 Command Line Utility
1. Compile the CLI tool with make:
```bash
make cli
```

2. Interact directly with images using the eikon CLI tool:
```bash
./bin/eikon_cli ./outputs/eikon_cli.ppm
```
```bash
._______.___ .____/\ ._______  .______  
: .____/: __|:   /  \: .___  \ :      \ 
| : _/\ | : ||.  ___/| :   |  ||       |
|   /  \|   ||     \ |     :  ||   |   |
|_.: __/|   ||      \ \_. ___/ |___|   |
   :/   |___||___\  /   :/         |___|
                  \/    :               
                                        
File dimensions are 800x800
Type help to show the menu
eikon@ppm:./outputs/eikon_cli.ppm$
```

3. If you want to use it from anywhere in your system, move the compiled binary to `/usr/bin`:
```bash
sudo mv ./bin/eikon_cli /usr/bin
```
