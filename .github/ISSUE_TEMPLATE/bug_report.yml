        How to write a good bug report ?

        - Respect the issue template as much as possible.
        - The title should be short and descriptive.
        - Explain the conditions which led you to report this issue: the context.
        - The context should lead to something, an idea or a problem that youâ€™re facing.
        - Describe what you were trying to achieve; maybe it's not a bug, but you were doing it incorrectly.
        - Remain clear and concise.
        - Format your messages to help the reader focus on what matters and understand the structure of your message, use Markdown syntax.
